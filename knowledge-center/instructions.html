<p>States and territories must submit these reports electronically to the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within 45 days after the end of each quarter. The data are used to calculate work participation rates, assess program performance, and meet statutory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>All data elements must be completed according to the definitions and coding instructions provided in this document. If a data element is not applicable, follow the coding rules for “not applicable” or “missing” as specified. Do not leave fields blank unless explicitly instructed.</p>
<p>Each record in the file must include a header segment with identifying information, followed by one or more data segments containing the case‑level details. The file layout, record lengths, and field positions must conform exactly to the specifications in these instructions.</p>
